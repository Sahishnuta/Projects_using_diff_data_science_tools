# Data Science Projects using Orange data mining tools

I have implemented two projects:

Project 1:
California is one of the places having the most deadliest and destructive wildfire seasons :fire: :fire:. The dataset contains the list of Wildfires that has occurred in California between 2013 and 2020. The dataset contains the location where wildfires have occurred including the County name, latitude and longitude values and also details on when the wildfire has started. 

This data helps to generate insights on what locations in California are under fire threat, what time do Wildfires usually occur and how frequent and devastating they are!!

Project 2:
We have data set of Car crash :red_car: :blue_car:, weather :sun_with_face: :sun_behind_small_cloud::cloud_with_snow: and holidays :fireworks::confetti_ball:. So, our task is to classify the data based on Severity.

You're provided with data about car crashes severity. The file contains 16 features, it represents the car crashes in the city of San Francisco between 2016 and 2020.

File descriptions
train.csv - the training set.
holidays.xml - Information about whether the day is a regular day or a holiday.
weather-sfcsv.csv - Information about the weather.
