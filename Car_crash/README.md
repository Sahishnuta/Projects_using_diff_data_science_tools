## Problem Statement

**Analyzing Car Crash Patterns and Risk Factors to Improve Road Safety**

The project aims to investigate car crash data to identify:
- Key factors contributing to vehicle accidents
- Patterns in crash occurrences across different dimensions
- High-risk scenarios and demographics
- Temporal and spatial trends in accident data

## Key Objectives

1. **Demographic Analysis**: Understand how driver age, gender, and experience correlate with accident rates
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Identify patterns in crash occurrences by time of day, day of week, and seasonal trends
3. **Vehicle Analysis**: Examine how vehicle type, age, and condition impact accident severity
4. **Environmental Factors**: Analyze how weather, road conditions, and lighting affect crash likelihood
5. **Geospatial Patterns**: Identify high-risk locations and routes
6. **Accident Severity Prediction**: Determine factors that lead to fatal vs. non-fatal accidents

## Data Analysis Focus Areas

Based on the code, the project examines:

- **Driver Demographics**: Age distribution of drivers involved in crashes
- **Temporal Patterns**: 
  - Hourly distribution of accidents
  - Day-of-week trends
  - Seasonal variations
- **Vehicle Factors**:
  - Vehicle types most involved in accidents
  - Model year analysis
- **Crash Characteristics**:
  - Collision types
  - Impact points
  - Damage severity
- **Environmental Conditions**:
  - Weather during accidents
  - Road surface conditions
  - Lighting conditions

## Technical Approach

The project employs:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries and visualizations
- **Data Visualization**: Using various plotting techniques to uncover patterns
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying correlations and significant factors
- **Pattern Recognition**: Finding clusters and trends in the data

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Evidence-based recommendations for reducing accidents
2. **Policy Recommendations**: Insights for traffic management and safety regulations
3. **Driver Education**: Identifying key areas for driver training and awareness
4. **Infrastructure Improvements**: Suggestions for road design and safety features
5. **Predictive Models**: Foundation for developing accident prediction systems

This analysis serves as a foundation for developing targeted interventions to reduce car accidents and improve overall road safety through data-driven insights.
