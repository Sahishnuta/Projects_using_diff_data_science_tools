## Problem Statement

### **Analyzing Wildfire Patterns and Risks in California**

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of historical wildfire incidents in California to understand patterns, identify risk factors, and provide data-driven insights for wildfire prevention and management.

#### **Key Objectives:**

1. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Identify seasonal patterns and trends in wildfire occurrences
   - Analyze year-over-year changes in fire frequency and severity
   - Determine peak fire seasons and high-risk periods

2. **Geospatial Analysis**
   - Map fire incidents across California counties
   - Identify geographic hotspots and high-risk regions
   - Analyze spatial distribution patterns

3. **Causal Factor Analysis**
   - Investigate relationships between weather conditions and fire incidents
   - Analyze common causes of wildfires (human vs. natural)
   - Identify contributing environmental factors

4. **Impact Assessment**
   - Evaluate the scale and severity of fires through acreage burned
   - Assess response effectiveness through containment metrics
   - Analyze economic and environmental impacts

5. **Predictive Insights**
   - Identify patterns that could help predict future fire risks
   - Provide data-driven recommendations for resource allocation
   - Support emergency preparedness planning

#### **Data Sources:**
- Historical wildfire incident data from California government sources
- Geographic and temporal data points
- Fire cause classifications
- Containment and damage metrics

#### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Identification of high-risk areas and periods
- Understanding of primary fire causes and contributing factors
- Data visualization of fire patterns and trends
- Actionable insights for wildfire prevention and management strategies

The project serves as a data science case study for analyzing environmental disasters and providing evidence-based recommendations for public safety and resource management.
